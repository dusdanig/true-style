# True style checker

Be a brave stylist. Integrates with bash or any other build system. Is
faster and more elegant than other style checkers. It infinitly
configurable because it adapts the style checking instantaniously to
your own style.

Real style is truly stylish, the rest is cruft (TM).

## Instalation

No installation, except on Windows you will need cygwin.

## Usage

Where you would normally execute a crufty style checker replace it
with the bash true command. Your great style will be checked in a
whim.

$ true
